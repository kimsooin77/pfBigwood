                <h2>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h2>
                <p>After my military career as a Marine and my final tour in 2019, like many veterans, it was my first time since joining the military in my early 20’s where I had to go back to basics and decide on my next journey and career path. I grew up in the family business of building and renovating homes, so I have always been familiar with the process of making homes and people’s lives more beautiful. Through my first job after the Marine’s, I sort of fell into the wood business and began selling high quality slabs to builders and people doing DIY projects at home. I started experimenting with building furniture and discovered how amazing it was to watch a piece come together, as well as how happy it made my customers to take them home. I believe that so many moments and memories in life start in the home, and soon, the idea of Big Wood was born. I now run the business with help from some of my closest lifelong friends, family, and wife here in Nashville, TN!</p>
